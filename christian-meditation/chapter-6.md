## Christian meditation basics: process

[Christian meditation](https://testimon.io/what-is-christian-meditation) is all about taking time to be with God. Take a deep breathe and feel God's presence in your life. Fill yourself with gratitude towards God for His grace and His mercy in your life. Once you have done this, you are ready to start:

**Start with a verse**: Choose a Bible verse you want to meditate on. It all starts with the verse. Spend this time in silence as you ponder on the Bible verse. Pray to God to reveal His will for you in this verse. Bask in God's presence as you spend this period with Him. Take deep breaths. Be filled with God's peace. Lean on God and do not be anxious. Share your yolk with Jesus. Let Him be the master of your life.

**Commit the verse to your heart**: Take a few moments and repeat the verse to yourself. Use God's Word as a shield during the storms of life. Keep it close to your heart so you can draw on it at any moment. In [Ephesians 6:11](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/eph.6.11), it says: 

> "Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devilâ€™s schemes."

**Pray in gratitude**: Thank God for everything He has done for you. Thank God for uncovering something in you today. Be in an attitude of gratitude for what God has done and continues to do for you.

**Reflect on the verse**: Take a moment to write down your observation and what God's message is for you. Don't try and change what you find. Take a note of it. This way you can always remember where God is taking you in your life.

**Take it throughout the day**: Let your meditation of God's Word lead to a changed life. No longer be a slave to anxiety or depression. God has broken all the chains. Be compassionate. Be kind. Help your neighbor. Love people. Start bringing God's Kingdom to earth.

## Consistency

Christian meditation takes practice. It takes consistency to get good at it. As with anything new, the novelty may fade over time. It's easy to make excuses on why not to do it: you are too busy, too exhausted, too sad, too boring (to name a few).

It's worth noting that Christian meditation takes time to master. It takes patience, consistency, and perseverance. It takes effort to build a more intimate relationship with God. In [John 10:27](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jhn.10.27), Jesus says: 

> "My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me." Learn to follow God with your actions. The Gospel is worth it. God's reward is beyond this world.

Here are some tips to stay on course:

- **Be curious**: Christian meditation is all about God. Be curious in what He is saying to you. Deepen your relationship with Him.

- **Keep an open mind**: Don't let your preconceived notion ruin your experience.

- **Be patient**: Christian meditation is a life-long journey. The more you practice, the better you become. This will help you to become more consistent.
