## Christian meditation vs. mindfulness

Worry is the root of stress and [anxiety](https://testimon.io/christian-meditation/anxiety). It wreaks havoc on our minds and bodies. Worry is the thief that robs us of His peace.

[Mindfulness](https://testimon.io/blog/mindfulness-benefits) is a form of meditation where the focus is on being present. Mindfulness encourages you not to judge yourself, and to not worry about the past or future. [Mindfulness](https://testimon.io/blog/mindfulness-benefits) is challenging in our age of distraction. We often "future-trip" over the "what-ifs" of our lives.

In [James 4:13](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jas.4.13), it says: 

> "Now listen, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money.” Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. Instead, you ought to say, “If it is the Lord’s will, we will live and do this or that.” As it is, you boast in your arrogant schemes. All such boasting is evil. If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn’t do it, it is sin for them."

Being present means trusting Jesus Christ. You cannot live in the present if you worry about the future.

The Bible says we should meditate on the Book of the Law day and night. The basis of Christian meditation is to focus on Scripture and praying on how they apply to our lives. We learn to be silent while listening for God's wisdom.

When God speaks to our hearts, something gets stirred up in our hearts. We learn to recognize His voice, and feel peace in His presence.

[Christian meditation](https://testimon.io/what-is-christian-meditation) is Bible-based. When our foundation is of faith, it provides nourishment to the seed planted in our spirit. God is a Spirit, and we are made in His image and likeness. In [Genesis 1:27](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/gen.1.27): 

> "So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them."
