## How do Christians meditate?

Let's put aside all your preconceived notion of meditation and start from scratch. Like prayer, meditation starts with a personal relationship with [Jesus Christ](https://testimon.io/blog/jesus-quotes-about-love). Biblical meditation is about quieting our hearts with Scripture. It has been used in monastic tradition since the fourth century. It is commonly referred to as **lectio divina**, or sacred reading. Biblical meditation is a statement of faith. It lets you have union with God. Grab a Bible and consider these simple ways to get started:

**Contemplative Prayer**

The key to contemplative prayer is to focus on God's glory. This involves a period of mental prayer based in the Word of God. Building a habit of 10 minutes a day can have significant impact on your day. A Christian's prayer life is important to our welfare. We may encounter life challenges, but we will never be shaken if God is at the center. Breathe in and realize God's goodness in your life. Use this period to listen to what God is saying to you. Open your heart to the Holy Spirit. 

**Memorizing Verses**

God wants us to be close to His word. He wants us to keep it in our hearts. Bible study helps us learn more about God’s nature. In [Psalms 119:11](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/psa.119.11), it says: 

> "I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you". 

Being able to recall Scripture is powerful. You can call on it during periods of stress and hardship. Memorizing verses help you commit God's Word to the top of mind. Connect your mind with God's. Know His thoughts through His Word.

**Writing in a Journal**

Writing down your thoughts can be meditation in itself. It allows you to have a quiet period with God and read the word. By writing down your thoughts on the Scripture, you may uncover God's message in your life. It also helps commit verses to memory. Let the Holy Spirit be your guide. 

**Be in His Creation**

Spend time with God's creation. Take a walk in nature and enjoy a period of prayer time with God. The Bible says God's “*invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made*” ([Romans 1:20](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/rom.1.20)). Nature reveals God in unique ways. From the beauty of a sunset and the bloom of a flower, God is at work. If it's hard to sit still, take a walk. Walking in nature is a meditative practice that calms your busy mind. The Holy Spirit is waiting to talk to you.
