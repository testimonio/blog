## Guided and unguided Christian meditation

Christian meditation starts and ends with God's word. If you have a Bible, you can get started today. With any new habit, beginners often benefit with the help of a guide - in person or via a recording. Guided Christian meditation provides clear instruction and support for the end-user.

Unguided Christian meditation is a solo focus on God's word. A person can do unguided Christian meditation with a Bible and focus on God's word. Unguided Christian meditation is not easy to do without the proper experience. It's like flying a plane without an instructor.

Guided Christian meditation is like learning to fly with an experienced pilot. They will offer you nuggets of wisdom and encouragement. Some people will need this guidance for a long period of time. Others will go alone after learning the fundamentals.
