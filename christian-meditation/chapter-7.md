## Health benefits of Christian meditation

Through a MRI, we can observe what meditation actually does in the brain. Brain scans of people who meditated consistently for years [showed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3184843/) increaed gray-matter density in the hippocampus. This is the area important for learning, memory, self-awareness, and compassion. We can also observe a decreased density in the amygdala (which processes fear, anxiety, and stress).

In general, our [brains](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/use-your-mind-change-your-brain/201305/is-your-brain-meditation) interpret the world through the medial prefrontal cortex. This is also known as the "me center". This part of the brain plays a big role in regulating anxiety and safety. Meditation decreases the neural connections to the "me center". When your brain is less focused on yourself, you feel less anxious and fearful.

In short, mindfulness meditation builds new positive neural pathways while decreasing negative pathways. Meditation can actually result in [rewiring the brain](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/05/15/the-effects-of-meditation-on-the-brain/) for the better.

## Christian meditation for managing stress, anxiety, sleep, or depression

## Stress

Stress is common in today's world. Stress can come from anything ranging from traffic, work, to relationships. This is why Christian meditation is the perfect antidote for today's world.

Chronic stress is a key culprit behind a plethora of mental and physical health issues. It is important to deal with it before it gets worse. People who experience stress may discover [huge benefits](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/mindfulness-meditation-may-ease-anxiety-mental-stress-201401086967) from Christian meditation. [Studies](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1809754) found evidence that mindfulness meditation eased symptoms of depression, anxiety, and pain related to stress.

Learning Christian meditation helps you handle the stress of the world. It helps you not panic when things don't go your way. It reduces the amount of stress we put on ourselves to perform. We learn to lean on Jesus when we encounter hardships. We learn to change how we react to our circumstances.

## Sleep

Meditation can improve sleep quality for people with insomnia. Christian meditation evokes a relaxation response in your body during the day. This helps make it easier to fall asleep at night. The goal of Christian meditation is to create a reflex of peace in your life.

One of the major causes of insomnia is a high-level of stress. Some nights, you may feel exhausted but your mind keeps racing. You are unable to come down from a state of heightened alert. Through meditation, people reported improved sleep quality.

Let go of the racing thoughts of your mind. Let God give you peace. Focus on the Scripture. God's promises live there.

## Depression

300 million people [experience depression](http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/depression) worldwide. Depression manifests other ailments, such as insomnia or lack of focus. Depression symptoms differ for individuals. Studies have shown [significant improvements](http://www.apa.org/monitor/2015/03/cover-mindfulness.aspx) from meditation.

[Multiple studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27111302) have found internet-based mindfulness programs drastically lowered stress, anxiety, and depression. Guided meditation performed better than unguided, in most cases.
