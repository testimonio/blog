## What is Biblical Christian meditation? 

[Christian meditation](https://testimon.io/what-is-christian-meditation) is an experience and a skill. Christian meditation begins in our prayer life. It is a form of prayer in which a person meditates on the Word of God and reflects on God's revelation in their life. By sitting in peace with God, we are training to be more open and at ease with God's plan. Through the Word of God, we discover greater peace, calm, contentment, and compassion. In doing so, we learn to experience the blessings of the present moment. This is how Christian meditation becomes a powerful part of our spiritual life.

Here are some helpful ways to describe what Christian meditation is not:

- Christian meditation is not "mindlessness" or "detachment" from reality. It is unlike eastern meditations, or eastern meditation practices. It is not transcendental meditation.

- Christian meditation is not an escape hatch. It should not be a way to run from your obligations.

- Christian meditation is not about magically changing into a better person.

- Christian meditation is not about burning candles, or sitting calmly on a rug. Non-Christian meditation practices will often encourage these practices.

- Christian meditation does not guarantee contentment or bliss. Bliss can be a side effect, but Christian meditation involves a whole range of feelings.

- Christian meditation is not contrary to Christian teachings. It is mentioned in the Bible 23 times.

Christian meditation is a statement of faith. It is all about God's will and being in union with God. In the Bible, it states “keep this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful.” (Joshua 1:8 NIV). The Bible is the easiest way to meditate on God's will. Biblical meditation allows for us to understand what God is doing in our lives. It is all about paying attention to God's love. The ultimate goal of Christian meditation is to live like Jesus Christ. The practice of meditation should lead to a changed life in the presence of God.
