In Christianity, the [**Logos**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos_(Christianity)) (Greek: Λόγος, "Word", "Discourse", or "Reason") is a title for Jesus Christ. In the standard Bible, Jesus holds many titles. Jesus is called: Son of God, Christ the Son, Bread of Life, or Lamb of God. Jesus as the Word is not a common reference we hear in Christian life. However, it is important to know Christ as the Word. In the *[John 1:1-5 (King James Version)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A1-14&version=NIV)*, John the Baptist uses the word Logos to describe Jesus in the beginning (or before creation):

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.

Jesus is the Christ. There is life in the name of Jesus. He holds the grace and truth. Calling Jesus the Word is a statement of faith in our Christian life. In Jesus the Son, the Word became flesh and dwelt among us. Through the Word of God is the only way to eternal life. If you believe that Jesus is the Word of God, you will have eternal life.

From every Bible study to daily devotionals, every word in the [Bible](https://www.bible.com/) reveal God's hidden nature. Christian theology is based around the Word of God. It reveals God's love for mankind. It gives us the way to live to be present with God. It contains all the questions and answers about the world man can ever think of. Every Word in the Bible is dipped in blood of the Saviour. This is why we call Jesus the Word.

## Jesus in the Trinity

Jesus is God's spoken word. He is the communication of God to mankind. Christian doctrine solidifies Jesus's place in the [Trinity](https://www.christianity.com/god/trinity/god-in-three-persons-a-doctrine-we-barely-understand-11634405.html) with God the Father and the Holy Spirit. He was in the beginning with God. He is one with the invisible God. 

## Refuting False Doctrines

John the Baptist wrote these words specifically to refute the teachings of [Certinthus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerinthus), who believed that the world was created by a power far removed from and ignorant of the Father. 

As the Logos, Jesus Christ is both the Light and the Life. Jesus is God to the extent that he can be present and known to man. The Logos is God active in creation, revelation, and redemption. Jesus Christ not only gives God's Word to us humans; he is the Word. Bible verses from the Old to the New Testament all point to the fact that Jesus is God.

## Fulfulling the Purpose

After Jesus arrived to meet with his creation, he fulfilled the Father's purpose by providing a representation of the Godhead to man. In [*Hebrews 1:1-3 (American Standard Version)*](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+1%3A1-3&version=NIV): 

> God, having of old time spoken unto the fathers in the prophets by divers portions and in divers manners, hath at the end of these days spoken unto us in his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the worlds; who being the effulgence of his glory, and the very image of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had made purification of sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;

Jesus is the Word because he represents the Father's invisible nature to His creations.

## Conclusion

Jesus is the Word of God to man. He is our salvation and our and our way to the Father. Trust in Jesus, read the Bible, and pray for God's revelation in your life. The way to get closer to Jesus is through the Bible, and trust that His plans for you are good.
