In Christianity, the **Logos** (Greek: Λόγος, "Word", "Discourse", or "Reason") is a title for Jesus Christ. In [John 1:1-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A1-14&version=NIV), John the Apostle uses the word Logos to describe Jesus in the beginning (or before creation):

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.

## Jesus in the Trinity

Jesus is God's spoken word, according to John's gospel. This verse solidifies Jesus's place in the Trinity, where the "Word was with God, and the Word was God". 

## Refuting False Doctrines

John wrote these words specifically to refute the teachings of [Certinthus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerinthus), who believed that the world was created by a power far removed from and ignorant of the Father. 

As the Logos, Jesus Christ is both the Light and the Life. He  is God to the extent that he can be present and known to man. The Logos is God active in creation, revelation, and redemption. Jesus Christ not only gives God's Word to us humans; he is the Word.

## Fulfulling the Purpose

After Jesus arrived to meet with his creation, he fulfilled the Father's purpose by providing a representation of the Godhead to man. In [Hebrews 1:1-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+1%3A1-3&version=NIV): 

> In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also he made the universe. The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven.

Jesus is the Word because he represents the Father's invisible nature to His creations.

## Conclusion

Jesus is the Word of God to man. He is our salvation and our and our way to the Father. Trust in Jesus, read the Word, and pray for God's revelation in your life. The way to get closer to Jesus is through the Word, and trust that His plans for you are good.
