Screens create an artificial blue light, which tricks your brain into thinking that it's still daytime. It reduces the production of melatonin. Blue light exposure is a major detriment to our sleep time.

**11. Try melatonin supplements**

Melatonin is a sleep hormone that helps you regulate your sleep-wake cycle. It tells you when it's time to go to sleep. It's a popular sleep aid that can help you treat insomnia. Taking a 2 mg dose of melatonin before bed helps boost sleep quality and helps you fall sleep faster.
